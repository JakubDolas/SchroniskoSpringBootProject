informationAboutPage1=Our shelter is a place full of love, dedication, and care for animals that need a new home and attention. For years, we have been rescuing abandoned and homeless animals, providing them with safety and a chance for a better life. We believe that every creature deserves a chance to find a loving home where it will be surrounded by care and support.

Thanks to their commitment, every animal receives individual care and the opportunity for adaptation and rehabilitation. Every day, we make sure that our wards have the right conditions and receive all the necessary help \u2013 from basic health care to socialization.
informationAboutPage3=Our mission is not only to rescue animals but also to educate society about responsible care and adoption. We believe that through cooperation, we can create a world in which every animal will be loved and respected. We invite you to meet our residents and support our mission \u2013 together we can change their lives for the better.
